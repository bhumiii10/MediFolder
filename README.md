*Complete Description*            
This is my submission for Microsoft Engage'22. I have made this wesbite using:
Face Api Js JavaScript API for face detection and face recognition in the browser and nodejs with tensorflow.js
TensorFlow.js Library for machine learning in JavaScript
Express js to create a node server
Jquery, HTML and CSS for web page
This was my first attempt at building a website from scratch.
